# Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application designed to help students and enthusiasts better understand algorithms and data structures. By visually representing algorithms in real-time, this platform turns complex concepts into intuitive, interactive experiences. Users can explore various algorithms step-by-step, observe the underlying processes, and gain deeper insights into how algorithms work. This tool is ideal for both beginners and advanced learners, making the learning process engaging, educational, and fun.

## Features
List out the key features of your application.

- **Algorithm Selection Sidebar**: Allows users to choose from various algorithms for visualization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step animation for each algorithm, enabling users to adjust speed and customize data.
- **Educational Content**: Detailed descriptions of each algorithm with their complexity analysis.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
List your design decisions and assumptions.

- **Responsiveness**: The UI is designed to work smoothly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Modular Code**: Code is modular for easy scalability; each algorithm is a separate module.
- **Animation Framework**: Used CSS and JavaScript animations for smooth visualization transitions.
