# Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application designed to help students and enthusiasts better understand algorithms and data structures. By visually representing algorithms in real-time, this platform turns complex concepts into intuitive, interactive experiences. Users can explore various algorithms step-by-step, observe the underlying processes, and gain deeper insights into how algorithms work. This tool is ideal for both beginners and advanced learners, making the learning process engaging, educational, and fun.

## Features
List out the key features of your application.

- **Algorithm Selection Sidebar**: Allows users to choose from various algorithms for visualization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step animation for each algorithm, enabling users to adjust speed and customize data.
- **Educational Content**: Detailed descriptions of each algorithm with their complexity analysis.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
List your design decisions and assumptions.

- **Responsiveness**: The UI is designed to work smoothly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Modular Code**: Code is modular for easy scalability; each algorithm is a separate module.
- **Animation Framework**: Used CSS and JavaScript animations for smooth visualization transitions.

## Installation & Getting Started
Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/username/algorithm-visualizer.git
    cd algorithm-visualizer](https://github.com/PoojaSingh31github/Al_Orbiters_005.git)
    ```


4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:PORT`.


## Usage
Provide instructions and examples on how to use your project.

1. Choose an algorithm from the sidebar (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
2. Input custom data for the algorithm or use the default dataset.
3. Press "Start" to visualize the algorithm's step-by-step process.
4. Adjust the speed of the visualization using the speed control slider.

```bash
# Example:
Choose "Merge Sort", input [12, 5, 7, 9], and click "Start". The algorithm will be visualized step-by-step.
